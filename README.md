Supervised learning problems can be grouped into regression and classification problems.<br>

**Classification:** A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”.<br>
**Regression:** A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as “dollars” or “weight”.
