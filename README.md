## SL-MLA - Supervised Learning - Machine Learning Algorithms.

Supervised learning problems can be grouped into regression and classification problems.<br>
[**Classification:**](https://github.com/prashanthms99/SL-MLA/tree/master/Classification) A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease” or loan deafult yes or no.<br>
[**Regression:**](https://github.com/prashanthms99/SL-MLA/tree/master/Regression) A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as “dollars” or “weight”.

**Note:** The data sets used in this repository only for understanding and exploring Machine Learning Algorithms.
